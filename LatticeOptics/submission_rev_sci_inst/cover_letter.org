Dear Editor,

we would like to submit our paper "Implementation of a stable, high-power optical lattice for quantum gas microscopy" for consideration in Review of Scientific Instruments.

In this paper, we provide a detailed review of the high-power laser technology that enabled  our recent advances in quantum gas microscopy of fermions in optical lattices, such as the creation of antiferromagnetic states with very low entropies. We explain in detail the optical, the mechanical, and the electronic components that enabled these developments, and we present new data that demonstrates unprecedented short-term (hours) as well as long-term (6 months) stability of our optical lattices.

We believe that the methods we developed to obtain such highly-stable, low-noise, and high-power optical lattices have applications in many other quantum optics experiments and technologies requiring long coherence times and low entropies. To make our techniques available to a broader audience, we would like to publish our results in Review of Scientific Instruments.

With best regards,

Sebastian Blatt on behalf of the authors
