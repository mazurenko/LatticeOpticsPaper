abstract = {A network is frustrated when competing interactions between nodes prevent each bond from being satisfied. This compromise is central to the behaviour of many complex systems, from social and neural networks to protein folding and magnetism. Frustrated networks have highly degenerate ground states, with excess entropy and disorder even at zero temperature. In the case of quantum networks, frustration can lead to massively entangled ground states, underpinning exotic materials such as quantum spin liquids and spin glasses. Here we realize a quantum simulation of frustrated Ising spins in a system of three trapped atomic ions, whose interactions are precisely controlled using optical forces. We study the ground state of this system as it adiabatically evolves from a transverse polarized state, and observe that frustration induces extra degeneracy. We also measure the entanglement in the system, finding a link between frustration and ground-state entanglement. This experimental system can be scaled to simulate larger numbers of spins, the ground states of which (for frustrated interactions) cannot be simulated on a classical computer.},

abstract = {Understanding exotic forms of magnetism in quantum mechanical systems is a central goal of modern condensed matter physics, with implications for systems ranging from high-temperature superconductors to spintronic devices. Simulating magnetic materials in the vicinity of a quantum phase transition is computationally intractable on classical computers, owing to the extreme complexity arising from quantum entanglement between the constituent magnetic spins. Here we use a degenerate Bose gas of rubidium atoms confined in an optical lattice to simulate a chain of interacting quantum Ising spins as they undergo a phase transition. Strong spin interactions are achieved through a site-occupation to pseudo-spin mapping. As we vary a magnetic field, quantum fluctuations drive a phase transition from a paramagnetic phase into an antiferromagnetic phase. In the paramagnetic phase, the interaction between the spins is overwhelmed by the applied field, which aligns the spins. In the antiferromagnetic phase, the interaction dominates and produces staggered magnetic ordering. Magnetic domain formation is observed through both in situ site-resolved imaging and noise correlation measurements. By demonstrating a route to quantum magnetism in an optical lattice, this work should facilitate further investigations of magnetic models using ultracold atoms, thereby improving our understanding of real magnetic materials. Quantum spins arranged on a lattice and coupled to one another through magnetic interactions constitute a paradigmatic model sys-tem in condensed matter physics. Such systems produce a rich array of magnetically ordered ground states, such as paramagnets, ferro-magnets and antiferromagnets. Certain geometries and interactions induce competition between these orderings in the form of frustra-tion, resulting in spin liquids 1 and spin glasses 2 , as well as phases with topological order 3 . Varying system parameters can induce quantum phase transitions between the various phases 4 . A deeper understand-ing of the competition and resulting transitions between magnetic phases would provide valuable insights into the properties of complex materials such as high-temperature superconductors 5 , and more generally into the intricate behaviours that can emerge when many simple quantum mechanical objects interact with one another. Studying quantum phase transitions of magnetic condensed matter systems is hindered by the complex structure and interactions present in such systems, as well as by the difficulty of controllably varying system parameters.

abstract = {Quantum magnetism originates from the exchange coupling between quantum mechanical spins. Here, we report on the observation of nearest-neighbor magnetic correlations emerging in the many-body state of a thermalized Fermi gas in an optical lattice. The key to obtaining short-range magnetic order is a local redistribution of entropy, which allows temperatures below the exchange energy for a subset of lattice bonds. When loading a repulsively interacting gas into either dimerized or anisotropic simple cubic configurations of a tunable-geometry lattice, we observe an excess of singlets as compared with triplets consisting of two opposite spins. For the anisotropic lattice, the transverse spin correlator reveals antiferromagnetic correlations along one spatial axis. Our work facilitates addressing open problems in quantum magnetism through the use of quantum simulation.
Fermionic Quantum Magnetism
Optical lattices loaded with cold atoms have been used successfully as quantum simulators of condensed matter systems; however, in the case of fermionic quantum magnetism, achieving low enough temperatures has been a major obstacle. Greif et al. (p. 1307, published online 23 May; see the Perspective by Porto) selectively tuned the exchange interactions in an optical lattice of fermions, forcing a redistribution of entropy such that in the low-entropy subsystem the effective temperature was sufficiently low enough to lead to magnetic correlations.},

@article{Drewes2017,
abstract = {Near zero temperature, quantum magnetism can non-trivially arise from short-range interactions, but the occurrence of magnetic order depends crucially on the interplay of interactions, lattice geometry, dimensionality and doping. Even though the consequences of this interplay are not yet fully understood, quantum magnetism is believed to be connected to a range of complex phenomena in the solid state, for example, in the context of high-{\$}T{\_}c{\$} superconductivity and spin liquids in frustrated lattices. Ultracold atomic Fermi gases in optical lattices constitute an experimental system with unrivalled tunability and detection capabilities to explore quantum magnetism by analog quantum simulation. In this work, we study the emergence of antiferromagnetic correlations between ultracold fermionic atoms in two dimensions with decreasing temperature. We determine the magnetic susceptibility of the Hubbard model from simultaneous measurements of the in-situ density of both spin components. At half-filling and strong interactions our data approach the Heisenberg model of localized spins with antiferromagnetic correlations. Moreover, we observe the disappearance of magnetic correlations when the system is doped away from half-filling. Our observation of the dependence of quantum magnetism on doping paves the way for future studies on the emergence of pseudogap and pairing phenomena away from half-filling.},

Already near room temperature, doped copper oxide materials display remarkable features such as a pseudo-gap and a "strange metal" phase with unusual transport properties. The essence of this physics is believed to be captured by the Fermi-Hubbard model of repulsively interacting, itinerant fermions on a lattice. Here we report on the site-resolved observation of charge and spin correlations in the two-dimensional (2D) Fermi-Hubbard model realized with ultracold atoms. Antiferromagnetic spin correlations are maximal at half-filling and weaken monotonically upon doping. Correlations between singly charged sites are negative at large doping, revealing the Pauli and correlation hole$\backslash$textemdash a suppressed probability of finding two fermions near each other. However, as the doping is reduced below a critical value, correlations between such local magnetic moments become positive, signaling strong bunching of doublons and holes. Excellent agreement with numerical linked-cluster expansion (NLCE) and determinantal quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) calculations is found. Positive non-local moment correlations directly imply potential energy fluctuations due to doublon-hole pairs, which should play an important role for transport in the Fermi-Hubbard model.},

For example, doping an antiferromagnet is expected to give rise to pseudogap states and high-temperature superconductors 1 . Quantum simulation 2–8 using ultracold fermions in optical lattices could help to answer open questions about the doped Hubbard Hamiltonian 9–14 , and has recently been advanced by quantum gas microscopy 15–20 . Here we report the realization of an antiferromagnet in a repulsively interacting Fermi gas on a two-dimensional square lattice of about 80 sites at a temperature of 0.25 times the tunnelling energy. The antiferromagnetic long-range order manifests through the divergence of the correlation length, which reaches the size of the system, the development of a peak in the spin structure factor and a staggered magnetization that is close to the ground-state value. We hole-dope the system away from half-filling, towards a regime in which complex many-body states are expected, and find that strong magnetic correlations persist at the antiferromagnetic ordering vector up to dopings of about 15 per cent. In this regime, numerical simulations are challenging 21 and so experiments provide a valuable benchmark. Our results demonstrate that microscopy of cold atoms in optical lattices can help us to understand the low-temperature Fermi–Hubbard model.},
