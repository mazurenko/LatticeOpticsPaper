abstract = {The two-dimensional frustrated next nearest neighbor Heisenberg model on the square lattice is a prime example for a spin system where quantum fluctuations can either destroy or stabilize magnetic order. The phase boundaries and staggered moment dependence on the frustration ratio J2/J1 of the exchange constants are fairly well understood both from approximate analytical and numerical methods. In this work we use exact diagonalization for finite clusters for an extensive investigation of the more general J 1a,b -J2 model which includes a spatial exchange anisotropy between next-neighbor spins. We introduce a systematic way of tiling the square lattice and, for this low symmetry model, define a controlled procedure for the finite size scaling that is compatible with the possible magnetic phases. We obtain ground state energies, structure factors and ordered moments and compare with the results of spin wave calculations. We conclude that J 1a,b exchange anisotropy strongly stabilizes the columnar antiferromagnetic phase for all frustration parameters, in particular in the region of the spin nematic phase of the isotropic model.},

The sharp Fermi surface of the noninteracting limit is significantly broadened by the electronic correlations but retains signatures of the approach to the edges of the first Brillouin zone as the density increases. Finite-size scaling of simulations on large lattices allows us to extract the interaction dependence of the antiferromagnetic order parameter, exhibiting its evolution from weak-coupling to the strong-coupling Heisenberg limit. Our lattices provide improved resolution of the Green's function in momentum space, allowing a more quantitative comparison with time-of-flight optical lattice experiments.},

The technique is based on fast, real-time control of 100 optical tweezers, which we use to arrange atoms in desired geometric patterns and to maintain these configurations by replacing lost atoms with surplus atoms from a reservoir.

abstract = {Ultracold atoms in optical lattices are a versatile platform for creating quantum many-body states of matter. These systems may be able to address some of the most important issues in many-body physics, such as high-temperature (high-{\{}{\$}{\}}T{\{}{\_}{\}}c{\{}{\$}{\}}) superconductivity. The Hubbard model describes many of the features shared by the cuprate superconductors, including an interaction-driven Mott insulating state and antiferromagnetism (AFM). Optical lattices filled with a two-spin-component Fermi gas of ultracold atoms can faithfully realize the Hubbard model with readily tunable parameters, and thus provide a platform for its systematic exploration. Realization of strongly correlated phases in optical lattices, however, has been hindered by the need to cool the atoms to temperatures as low as the magnetic exchange energy, and also by the lack of reliable thermometry. Here we demonstrate spin-sensitive Bragg scattering of light, in analogy to neutron scattering in condensed matter, and use it to measure the spin correlations at temperatures down to 1.4 times that of the AFM phase transition. We achieve these low temperatures using a novel compensated lattice to flatten the confining potential, tune the density, and mitigate heating in the lattice. We deduce the temperature of the atoms in the lattice by comparing the light scattering to determinantal quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) and numerical linked-cluster expansion (NLCE) calculations, using the local density approximation (LDA) to account for the inhomogeneity of the density. Further refinement of the compensated lattice may produce even lower temperatures which, along with light scattering thermometry, has important implications for achieving other novel quantum states and addressing the role of the Hubbard model in cuprate superconductivity.},

@article{Singh1991,
abstract = {The homogeneous Hartree-Fock antiferromagnetic (AF) state of the doped Hubbard model is shown to be unstable for infinitesimal doping concentration. Driven by long-wavelength intraband fluctuations, this instability with respect to infinitesimal fluctuations around the mean-field state is inferred from the nature of the static spin response, which increases away from the AF wave vector (7r, s). The effective interaction between antiparallel-spin holes in the lower band is found to contain a short-range attractive component, with an energy scale Jx. We discuss the crossover of the characteristic length scale for intraband fiuctuations from the antiferromagnetic state to the spiral state, also unstable for infinitesimal doping concentration. The ground state of the doped Hubbard model, and the nature of interaction between quasiparticles, has been a subject of intense theoretical activity in recent years. The interaction between holes at the Fermi surface in the antiferromagnetic spin-density-wave (SDW) state has been studied, interactions due to exchange both of longitudinal and transverse spin fluctuations. The in-teraction due to transverse spin fluctuations was shown to reduce, in the strong-coupling (large-U/t) limit, to the result for the bare interaction in the t-J model. These studies, dealing with a finite number of holes in an otherwise ordered antiferromagnet, and considering the spin-fluctuation processes of the undoped antiferro-magnet, strictly address only the zero-doping limit. The simplest Hartree-Fock antiferromagnetic state for the doped system is obtained by introducing holes in the lower-band Hartree-Fock states of the undoped antifer-romagnet, yielding the self-consistent, "rigid-band" anti-ferromagnetic state in which the order parameter is self-consistently determined for the finite density of holes. In this case one must consider the intraband spin fluc-tuations as well, in addition to the interband processes. The interband processes in the transverse spin suscepti-bility represent the spin-flip amplitudes and lead to the spin-wave dynamics in the broken-symmetry state. The intraband processes within the lower band (for the},

We demonstrate its etliciency in the two-dimensional O(n) cr models for n = I (Is-ing) and n =2 (x-y) at their critical temperatures, and for n =3 (Heisenberg) with correlation lengths around 10 and 20. On lattices up to 128 no sign of critical slowing down is visible with autocorrelation times of 1-2 steps per spin for estimators of long-range quantities, PACS numbers: 05.50.+q, 11.15.Ha Recently Swendsen and Wang (SW) ' have put for-ward a novel Monte Carlo algorithm for Potts spin mod-els using ideas from percolation theory. Whole clusters of spins are thus enabled to move in one step, and conse-quently critical slowing down is greatly improved. The information residing in the clusters can also be used to construct reduced variance estimators for physical ob-servables. The combination of both advantages was quite useful in recent studies of the physics of the four-dimensional p theory in the Ising limit. In Ref. 16, the sign of a variable length p field in two dimensions has been updated by SW, leading to the expected accelera-tion. The SW method has been developed further in two directions: In Ref. 5 it is claimed that critical slowing down in the two-dimensional Ising model is eliminated completely by a synthesis of SW with multigrid ideas. Other research was motivated by the desire to simu-late mode1s other than Potts systems, and, in particular, ones with continuous fields such as the x-y model. There the results on slowing down have been essentially nega-tive so far; improved estimators could be exploited in Ref. 6 for the O(3) a model albeit only for a variant ac-tion.

Because relatively low modulating fields are used, bv'){\&}bv4. Hence, terms involving fourth and higher degrees may be neglected. Also, bv is a constant for any one line. Thus, the detector responds to a signal that is proportional to O'I/Bv'. The argument is good, even for the (1+cosset) type modulation used, as contrasted with the ideal square pulse of the derivation. Since the actual applied field remains within 15 percent of its maximum and minimum values for half the period of modulation, it reasonably approximates the ideal square-pulse field. The more complex Zeeman splitting resulting from higher rotational states will yield more terms in this derivation, but. the net effect will be the same as that developed for the simplest case. The spin-wave theory of antiferromagnets, recently studied by Anderson for the absolute zero of temper-ature, is examined here for finite temperatures to derive the thermodynamic properties of antiferromagnets at low temperatures. Somewhat differently from Anderson's semiclassical treatment, the present theory has used the formulation devised by Holstein and Primakoff, upon which the thermodynamic quantities are derived quantum-statistically, The parallel susceptibility is shown to be proportional to H, while the perpendicular susceptibility is independent of the temperature in the first approximation but. decreases with increase in temperature if calculated in the second approximation. A tentative discussion is given of the nature of the divergences which arise in the simple formulation of spin-wave treatments in the absence of any kind of anisotropy.},

abstract = {In this article, a method is devised to study the energy spectrum for an excited electron con-figuration in an ideal crystal. The con6guration studied consists of a single excited electron taken out of a full band of N electrons. The multiplicity of the state is N'. It is shown that because of the Coulomb attraction between the electron and its hole ¹" states are split off from the bottom of the excited Bloch band; for these states the electron cannot escape its hole completely. The analogy of these levels to the spectrum of an atom or molecule is worked out quantitatively. The bottom of the 8loch band appears as "ionization potential" and the Bloch band itself as the continuum above this threshold energy. {\~{}}OR several years, there have been two com-peting pictures in use to describe the be-havior of electrons in crystals. The one adopted in most theoretical calculations and especially successful for metals describes each electron by a running wave, but Frenkel has shown that in many cases the more elementary atomic picture may be the better approximation. ' This ap-parent contradiction has been removed by Slater and Shockley, ' who showed with a simpli-fied model that the two types of states actually coexist in a crystal. It is the purpose of the present paper to treat this question in a quantita-tive way, starting out from the actual Hamil-tonian of the system. {\%}e shall restrict ourselves in this article to insulators containing one electron in the lowest excited state, and we shall study the energy spectrum of this single configuration, neglecting perturbations arising from other configurations. As to the method we shall proceed in the fol-lowing way: (1) We shall construct orthogonal "atomic" wave functions and express the energy matrix in this vector system. (2) The energy matrix contains many terms having the periodicity of the lattice and a few which have not; we shall develop a method which takes them both into account. (3) We shall derive some general results and discuss their consequences.},

abstract = {A network is frustrated when competing interactions between nodes prevent each bond from being satisfied. This compromise is central to the behaviour of many complex systems, from social and neural networks to protein folding and magnetism. Frustrated networks have highly degenerate ground states, with excess entropy and disorder even at zero temperature. In the case of quantum networks, frustration can lead to massively entangled ground states, underpinning exotic materials such as quantum spin liquids and spin glasses. Here we realize a quantum simulation of frustrated Ising spins in a system of three trapped atomic ions, whose interactions are precisely controlled using optical forces. We study the ground state of this system as it adiabatically evolves from a transverse polarized state, and observe that frustration induces extra degeneracy. We also measure the entanglement in the system, finding a link between frustration and ground-state entanglement. This experimental system can be scaled to simulate larger numbers of spins, the ground states of which (for frustrated interactions) cannot be simulated on a classical computer.},

abstract = {This document describes the basic structure and operation of the digital micromirror device (DMD) array. 1 Overview This document covers the basic structure and operation of DMD devices. The DMD is a unique combination of opto-mechanical and electro-mechanical elements. The journey begins with understanding how one pixel works and building on that to encompass the entire array of pixels that comprise a DMD. 2 Mirror (Pixel) The DMD pixel (mirror) is both an opto-mechanical element and an electro-mechanical element. 2.1 Bi-Stable Operation (±12 Degrees) The DMD pixel is an electro-mechanical element in that there are two stable micromirror states (+12° and –12° for most current DMDs) that are determined by geometry and electrostatics of the pixel during operation. The DMD pixel is an opto-mechanical element in that these two positions determine the direction that light is deflected. In particular, the DMD is a spatial light modulator. By convention, the positive (+) state is tilted toward the illumination and is referred to as the "on" state. Similarly, the negative (–) state is tilted away from the illumination and is referred to as the "off" state. Figure 1 shows two pixels, one in the on and one in the off state. These are the only operational states of the micromirror.},

We study the continuous (zero temperature) quantum phase transition from the superfluid to the Mott insulator phase induced by varying the depth of the optical potential, where the Mott insulator phase corresponds to a commensurate filling of the lattice (" optical crystal "). Examples for formation of Mott structures in optical lattices with a superimposed harmonic trap and in optical superlattices are presented.

abstract = {We study the conditions under which, using a canonical transformation, the phases sought after for the repulsive Hubbard model, namely, a Mott insulator in the paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases, and a putative d-wave superfluid can be deduced from observations in an optical lattice loaded with a spin-imbalanced ultracold Fermi gas with attractive interactions, thus realizing the attractive Hubbard model. We argue that the Mott insulator and antiferromagnetic phase of the repulsive Hubbard model are easier to observe in the attractive Hubbard mode as a band insulator of Cooper pairs and superfluid phase, respectively. The putative d-wave superfluid phase of the repulsive Hubbard model doped away from half filling is related to a d-wave antiferromagnetic phase for the attractive Hubbard model. We discuss the advantages of this approach to " quantum simulate " the Hubbard model in an optical lattice over the simulation of the doped Hubbard model in the repulsive regime. We also point out a number of technical difficulties of the proposed approach and, in some cases, suggest possible solutions.},

abstract = {Generalized Ising models, also known as cluster expansions, are an important tool in many areas of condensed-matter physics and materials science, as they are often used in the study of lattice thermodynamics, solid-solid phase transitions, magnetic and thermal properties of solids, and fluid mechanics. However, the problem of finding the global ground state of generalized Ising model has remained unresolved, with only a limited number of results for simple systems known. We propose a method to efficiently find the periodic ground state of a generalized Ising model of arbitrary complexity by a new algorithm which we term cluster tree optimization. Importantly, we are able to show that even in the case of an aperiodic ground state, our algorithm produces a sequence of states with energy converging to the true ground state energy, with a provable bound on error. Compared to the current state-of-the-art polytope method, this algorithm eliminates the necessity of introducing an exponential number of variables to counter frustration, and thus significantly improves tractability. We believe that the cluster tree algorithm offers an intuitive and efficient approach to finding and proving ground states of generalized Ising Hamiltonians of arbitrary complexity, which will help validate assumptions regarding local vs. global optimality in lattice models, as well as offer insights into the low-energy behavior of highly frustrated systems.},

abstract = {The interplay of magnetic fields and interacting particles can lead to exotic phases of matter exhibiting topological order and high degrees of spatial entanglement. While these phases were discovered in a solid-state setting, recent techniques have enabled the realization of gauge fields in systems of ultracold neutral atoms, offering a new experimental paradigm for studying these novel states of matter. This complementary platform holds promise for exploring exotic physics in fractional quantum Hall systems due to the microscopic manipulation and precision possible in cold atom systems. However, these experiments thus far have mostly explored the regime of weak interactions. Here, we show how strong interactions can modify the propagation of particles in a {\$}2\backslashtimes N{\$}, real-space ladder governed by the Harper-Hofstadter model. We observe inter-particle interactions affect the populating of chiral bands, giving rise to chiral dynamics whose multi-particle correlations indicate both bound and free-particle character. The novel form of interaction-induced chirality observed in these experiments demonstrates the essential ingredients for future investigations of highly entangled topological phases of many-body systems.},

All these phases break SU(2) symmetry and are gapless phases with magnon excitations. Different gapful quantum phases exist in two dimensions: the Valence Bond Crystal phases (VBC) which have long range order in local S=0 objects (either dimers in the usual Valence Bond acception or quadrumers..), but also Resonating Valence Bond Spin Liquids (RVBSL), which have no long range order in any local order parameter and an absence of susceptibility to any local probe. VBC have gapful S = 0, or 1 excitations, RVBSL on the contrary have deconfined spin-1/2 excitations. Examples of these two kinds of quantum phases are given in chapters 4 and 5. A special class of magnets (on the kagome or pyrochlore lattices) has an infinite local degeneracy in the classical limit: they give birth in the quantum limit to different behaviors which are illustrated and questionned in the last lecture.},

abstract = {The spectral shape of a source is of prime importance in optical coherence imaging because it determines several aspects of image quality, especially longitudinal resolution. Wide spectral bandwidth, which provides short coherence length, is sought to obtain high-resolution imaging. To estimate longitudinal resolution, the spectral shape of a source is usually assumed to be Gaussian, although the spectra of real sources are typically non-Gaussian. We discuss the limit of this assumption regarding the estimation of longitudinal resolution. To this end, we also investigate how coherence length is related to longitudinal resolution through the evaluation of different definitions of the coherence length. To demonstrate our purpose, the coherence length for several theoretical and real spectral shapes of sources having the same spectral bandwidth and central wavelength is computed. The reliability of coherence length computations toward the estimation of longitudinal resolution is discussed.},

We first discuss the properties of the model within the mean-field approximation: Be-cause of the form of the band structure, some peculiar features are found. We then discuss the simulation algorithm used and compare simulation results with exact results for 6-site chains to test the reliability of the approach. We present results for thermodynamic properties and correlation functions for lattices up to 8{\&}{\&}8 in spatial size. The system is found to be an antiferromagnetic in-sulator for all values of the coupling constant at zero temperature in the half-filled-band case, but the long-range order is much smaller than predicted by mean-field theory. We perform a finite-size-scaling analysis to determine the character of the transition at zero coupling. For non-half-filled-band cases, our results suggest that the system is always paramagnetic, in contradiction with Hartree-Fock predictions. The system does not show tendency to ferromagnetism nor triplet super-conductivity in the parameter range studied. We also discuss some properties of the attractive Hub-bard model in the half-filled-band case.},

abstract = {Strong electron correlations lie at the origin of transformative phenomena such as colossal magneto-resistance and high-temperature superconductivity. Already near room temperature, doped copper oxide materials display remarkable features such as a pseudo-gap and a "strange metal" phase with unusual transport properties. The essence of this physics is believed to be captured by the Fermi-Hubbard model of repulsively interacting, itinerant fermions on a lattice. Here we report on the site-resolved observation of charge and spin correlations in the two-dimensional (2D) Fermi-Hubbard model realized with ultracold atoms. Antiferromagnetic spin correlations are maximal at half-filling and weaken monotonically upon doping. Correlations between singly charged sites are negative at large doping, revealing the Pauli and correlation hole$\backslash$textemdash a suppressed probability of finding two fermions near each other. However, as the doping is reduced below a critical value, correlations between such local magnetic moments become positive, signaling strong bunching of doublons and holes. Excellent agreement with numerical linked-cluster expansion (NLCE) and determinantal quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) calculations is found. Positive non-local moment correlations directly imply potential energy fluctuations due to doublon-hole pairs, which should play an important role for transport in the Fermi-Hubbard model.},

@article{Liang2010,
abstract = {We have achieved high-precision laser beam shaping by using a binary-amplitude spatial light modulator, a digital micromirror device (DMD), followed by an imaging telescope that contains a pinhole low-pass filter (LPF). An error diffusion algorithm was used to design the initial DMD pixel pattern based on the measured input beam profile. This pattern was iteratively refined by simulating the optically low-pass filtered DMD image and changing DMD pixels to lift valleys and suppress peaks. We noted the gap between the experimental result of 1.4{\%} root-mean-square (RMS) error and the simulated result for the same DMD pattern of 0.3{\%} RMS error. Therefore, we deemed it necessary to introduce iterative refinement based on actual measurements of the output image to further improve the uniformity of the beam. Using this method, we have demonstrated the ability to shape raw, non-spatially filtered laser beams (quasi-Gaussian beams) into beams with precisely controlled profiles that have an unprecedented level of RMS error with respect to the target profile. We have shown that our iterative refinement process is able to improve the light intensity uniformity to around 1{\%} RMS error in a raw camera image for both 633 and 1064 nm laser beams. The use of a digital LPF on the camera image is justified in that it matches the performance of the pinhole filter in the experimental setup. The digital low-pass filtered results reveal that the actual optical beam profiles have RMS error down to 0.23{\%}. Our approach has also demonstrated the ability to produce a range of target profiles as long as they have similar spatial-frequency content (i.e., a slowly varying beam profile). Circular and square cross-section flat-top beams and beams with a linear intensity variation within a circular and square cross section were produced with similarly low RMS errors. The measured errors were about twice the ultimate limit of 0.1{\%} RMS error based on the number of binary DMD pixels that participate in the beam-formation process.},

While some introductory theoretical concepts are provided, including a discussion of the electronic band structure and phonon dispersion, the main emphasis is on describing relevant experiments and important results as well as some of the novel applications of graphene. In particular, this review covers graphene synthesis and characterization, field-effect behavior, electronic transport properties, magnetotransport, integer and fractional quantum Hall effects, mechanical properties, transistors, optoelectronics, graphene-based sensors, and biosensors. This approach attempts to highlight both the means by which the current understanding of graphene has come about and some tools for future contributions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Understanding exotic forms of magnetism in quantum mechanical systems is a central goal of modern condensed matter physics, with implications for systems ranging from high-temperature superconductors to spintronic devices. Simulating magnetic materials in the vicinity of a quantum phase transition is computationally intractable on classical computers, owing to the extreme complexity arising from quantum entanglement between the constituent magnetic spins. Here we use a degenerate Bose gas of rubidium atoms confined in an optical lattice to simulate a chain of interacting quantum Ising spins as they undergo a phase transition. Strong spin interactions are achieved through a site-occupation to pseudo-spin mapping. As we vary a magnetic field, quantum fluctuations drive a phase transition from a paramagnetic phase into an antiferromagnetic phase. In the paramagnetic phase, the interaction between the spins is overwhelmed by the applied field, which aligns the spins. In the antiferromagnetic phase, the interaction dominates and produces staggered magnetic ordering. Magnetic domain formation is observed through both in situ site-resolved imaging and noise correlation measurements. By demonstrating a route to quantum magnetism in an optical lattice, this work should facilitate further investigations of magnetic models using ultracold atoms, thereby improving our understanding of real magnetic materials. Quantum spins arranged on a lattice and coupled to one another through magnetic interactions constitute a paradigmatic model sys-tem in condensed matter physics. Such systems produce a rich array of magnetically ordered ground states, such as paramagnets, ferro-magnets and antiferromagnets. Certain geometries and interactions induce competition between these orderings in the form of frustra-tion, resulting in spin liquids 1 and spin glasses 2 , as well as phases with topological order 3 . Varying system parameters can induce quantum phase transitions between the various phases 4 . A deeper understand-ing of the competition and resulting transitions between magnetic phases would provide valuable insights into the properties of complex materials such as high-temperature superconductors 5 , and more generally into the intricate behaviours that can emerge when many simple quantum mechanical objects interact with one another. Studying quantum phase transitions of magnetic condensed matter systems is hindered by the complex structure and interactions present in such systems, as well as by the difficulty of controllably varying system parameters. With a few notable exceptions 6,7},

abstract = {We study particle and spin transport in a single-mode quantum point contact, using a charge neutral, quantum degenerate Fermi gas with tunable, attractive interactions. This yields the spin and particle conductance of the point contact as a function of chemical potential or confinement. The measurements cover a regime from weak attraction, where quantized conductance is observed, to the resonantly interacting superfluid. Spin conductance exhibits a broad maximum when varying the chemical potential at moderate interactions, which signals the emergence of Cooper pairing. In contrast, the particle conductance is unexpectedly enhanced even before the gas is expected to turn into a superfluid, continuously rising from the plateau at [Formula: see text] for weak interactions to plateau-like features at nonuniversal values as high as [Formula: see text] for intermediate interactions. For strong interactions, the particle conductance plateaus disappear and the spin conductance gets suppressed, confirming the spin-insulating character of a superfluid. Our observations document the breakdown of universal conductance quantization as many-body correlations appear. The observed anomalous quantization challenges a Fermi liquid description of the normal phase, shedding new light on the nature of the strongly attractive Fermi gas.},

A common expectation is that thermal fluctuations lead to fast decoherence and make dynamics classical. In this paper, we provide a striking example of a single particle created in a featureless, infinite temperature spin bath which not only exhibits non-classical dynamics but also induces strong long-lived correlations between the surrounding spins. We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of a hole created in a fermionic or bosonic Mott insulator in the atomic limit, which corresponds to a degenerate spin system. In the absence of interactions, the spin correlations arise purely from quantum interference, and the correlations are both antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic, in striking contrast to the equilibrium Nagaoka effect. These results are relevant for several condensed matter spin systems, and should be observable using state of the art bosonic or fermionic quantum gas microscopes.},

abstract = {1. Direct measurements of the minimum energy required for threshold vision under optimal physiological conditions yield values between 2.1 and 5.7 x 10(-10) ergs at the cornea, which correspond to between 54 and 148 quanta of blue-green light. 2. These values are at the cornea. To yield physiologically significant data they must be corrected for corneal reflection, which is 4 per cent; for ocular media absorption, which is almost precisely 50 per cent; and for retinal transmission, which is at least 80 per cent. Retinal transmission is derived from previous direct measurements and from new comparisons between the percentage absorption spectrum of visual purple with the dim-vision luminosity function. With these three corrections, the range of 54 to 148 quanta at the cornea becomes as an upper limit 5 to 14 quanta actually absorbed by the retinal rods. 3. This small number of quanta, in comparison with the large number of rods (500) involved, precludes any significant two quantum absorptions per rod, and means that in order to produce a visual effect, one quantum must be absorbed by each of 5 to 14 rods in the retina. 4. Because this number of individual events is so small, it may be derived from an independent statistical study of the relation between the intensity of a light flash and the frequency with which it is seen. Such experiments give values of 5 to 8 for the number of critical events involved at the threshold of vision. Biological variation does not alter these numbers essentially, and the agreement between the values measured directly and those derived from statistical considerations is therefore significant. 5. The results clarify the nature of the fluctuations shown by an organism in response to a stimulus. The general assumption has been that the stimulus is constant and the organism variable. The present considerations show, however, that at the threshold it is the stimulus which is variable, and that the properties of its variation determine the fluctuations found between response and stimulus.},

abstract = {We present two cooling mechanisms that lead to temperatures well below the Doppler limit. These mechanisms are based on laser polarization gradients and work at low laser power when the optical-pumping time between different ground-state sublevels becomes long. There is then a large time lag between the internal atomic response and the atomic motion, which leads to a large cooling force. In the simple case of one-dimensional molasses, we identify two types of polarization gradient that occur when the two counterpropagating waves have either orthogonal linear polarizations or orthogonal circular polarizations. In the first case, the light shifts of the ground-state Zeeman sublevels are spatially modulated, and optical pumping among them leads to dipole forces and to a Sisyphus effect analogous to the one that occurs in stimulated molasses. In the second case ($\sigma$+−$\sigma$− configuration), the cooling mechanism is radically different. Even at very low velocity, atomic motion produces a population difference among ground-state sublevels, which gives rise to unbalanced radiation pressures. From semiclassical optical Bloch equations, we derive for the two cases quantitative expressions for friction coefficients and velocity capture ranges. The friction coefficients are shown in both cases to be independent of the laser power, which produces an equilibrium temperature proportional to the laser power. The lowest achievable temperatures then approach the one-photon recoil energy. We briefly outline a full quantum treatment of such a limit.},

For example, doping an antiferromagnet is expected to give rise to pseudogap states and high-temperature superconductors 1 . Quantum simulation 2–8 using ultracold fermions in optical lattices could help to answer open questions about the doped Hubbard Hamiltonian 9–14 , and has recently been advanced by quantum gas microscopy 15–20 . Here we report the realization of an antiferromagnet in a repulsively interacting Fermi gas on a two-dimensional square lattice of about 80 sites at a temperature of 0.25 times the tunnelling energy. The antiferromagnetic long-range order manifests through the divergence of the correlation length, which reaches the size of the system, the development of a peak in the spin structure factor and a staggered magnetization that is close to the ground-state value. We hole-dope the system away from half-filling, towards a regime in which complex many-body states are expected, and find that strong magnetic correlations persist at the antiferromagnetic ordering vector up to dopings of about 15 per cent. In this regime, numerical simulations are challenging 21 and so experiments provide a valuable benchmark. Our results demonstrate that microscopy of cold atoms in optical lattices can help us to understand the low-temperature Fermi–Hubbard model.},

It can be used to obtain information on a system which is not available through conductance measurements. In particular, shot noise experiments can determine the charge and statistics of the quasiparticles relevant for transport, and reveal information on the potential profile and internal energy scales of mesoscopic systems. Shot noise is generally more sensitive to the effects of electron–electron interactions than the average conductance. We present a discussion based on the conceptually transparent scattering approach and on the classical Langevin and Boltzmann–Langevin methods; in addition a discussion of results which cannot be obtained by these methods is provided.

abstract = {Quantum Monte Carlo simulations, while being efficient for bosons, suffer from the ''negative sign problem'' when applied to fermions—causing an exponential increase of the computing time with the number of particles. A polynomial time solution to the sign problem is highly desired since it would provide an unbiased and numerically exact method to simulate correlated quantum systems. Here we show that such a solution is almost certainly unattainable by proving that the sign problem is nondeterministic polynomial (NP) hard, implying that a generic solution of the sign problem would also solve all problems in the complexity class NP in polynomial time. Half a century after the seminal Letter of Metropolis et al. [1] the Monte Carlo method has widely been estab-lished as one of the most important numerical methods and as a key to the simulation of many-body problems. Its main advantage is that it allows phase space integrals for many-particle problems, such as thermal averages, to be eval-uated in a time that scales only polynomially with the particle number N although the configuration space grows exponentially with N. This enables the accurate simulation of large systems with millions of particles. Monte Carlo simulations of quantum systems, such as fermions, bosons, or quantum spins, can be performed after mapping the quantum system to an equivalent classi-cal system. For fermionic or frustrated models this map-ping may yield configurations with negative Boltzmann weights, resulting in an exponential growth of the statisti-cal error and hence the simulation time with the number of particles, defeating the advantage of the Monte Carlo method. A polynomial time solution of this ''sign prob-lem'' of negative weights would revolutionize electronic structure calculations by providing an unbiased and approximation-free method to study correlated fermionic systems. This would be of invaluable help, for example, in finding the mechanism for high-temperature superconduc-tivity or in determining the properties of dense nuclear matter and quark matter. The difficulties in finding polynomial time solutions to the sign problem are reminiscent of the apparent impos-sibility to find polynomial time algorithms for nondeter-ministic polynomial (NP) complete decision problems, which could be solved in polynomial time on a hypotheti-cal nondeterministic machine, but for which no polyno-mial time algorithm is known for deterministic classical computers. A hypothetical nondeterministic machine can always follow both branches of an if statement simulta-neously, but can never merge the branches again. It can, equivalently, be viewed as having exponentially many processors, but without any communication between them. In addition, it must be possible to check a positive answer to a problem in NP on a classical computer in polynomial time. Many important computational problems in the com-plexity class NP, including the traveling salesman problem and the problem of finding ground states of spin glasses have the additional property of being NP hard, forming the subset of NP complete problems, the hardest problems in NP [2]. A problem is called NP hard if any problem in NP can be mapped onto it with polynomial complexity. Solving an NP hard problem is thus equivalent to solving any problem in NP, and finding a polynomial time solution to any of them would have important consequences for all of computing as well as the security of classical encryption schemes. In that case all problems in NP could be solved in polynomial time, and hence NP  P. As no polynomial solution to any of the NP complete problems was found despite decades of intensive research, it is generally believed that NP Þ P and no deterministic polynomial time algorithm exists for these problems. The proof of this conjecture remains as one of the unsolved millennium problems of mathematics for which the Clay Mathematics Institute has offered a prize of one million U.S. dollars [3]. In this Letter we will show that the sign problem is NP hard, implying that unless the NP Þ P conjecture is disproven there exists no generic solution of the sign problem. Before presenting the details of our proof, we will give a short introduction to classical and quantum Monte Carlo simulations and the origin of the sign problem. In the calculation of the phase space average of a quantity A, instead of directly evaluating the sum},

abstract = {A wide variety of experimental results and theoretical investigations in recent years have convincingly demonstrated that several transition metal oxides and other materials have dominant states that are not spatially homogeneous. This occurs in cases in which several physical interactions-spin, charge, lattice, and/or orbital-are simultaneously active. This phenomenon causes interesting effects, such as colossal magnetoresistance, and it also appears crucial to understand the high-temperature superconductors. The spontaneous emergence of electronic nanometer-scale structures in transition metal oxides, and the existence of many competing states, are properties often associated with complex matter where nonlinearities dominate, such as soft materials and biological systems. This electronic complexity could have potential consequences for applications of correlated electronic materials, because not only charge (semiconducting electronic), or charge and spin (spintronics) are of relevance, but in addition the lattice and orbital degrees of freedom are active, leading to giant responses to small perturbations. Moreover, several metallic and insulating phases compete, increasing the potential for novel behavior.},

abstract = {The Fermi-Hubbard model is a key concept in condensed matter physics and provides crucial insights into electronic and magnetic properties of materials. Yet, the intricate nature of Fermi systems poses a barrier to answering important questions concerning d-wave superconductivity and quantum magnetism. Recently, it has become possible to experimentally realize the Fermi-Hubbard model using a fermionic quantum gas loaded into an optical lattice. In this atomic approach to the Fermi-Hubbard model, the Hamiltonian is a direct result of the optical lattice potential created by interfering laser fields and short-ranged ultracold collisions. It provides a route to simulate the physics of the Hamiltonian and to address open questions and novel challenges of the underlying many-body system. This review gives an overview of the current efforts in understanding and realizing experiments with fermionic atoms in optical lattices and discusses key experiments in the metallic, band-insulating, superfluid, and Mott-insu...},

abstract = {It is argued that the long-wavelength, low-temperature behavior of a two-dimensional quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet can be described by a quantum nonlinear o model in two space plus one time dimension, at least in the range of parameters where the model has long-range order at zero temperature. The properties of the quantum nonlinear cr model are analyzed approximately using the one-loop renormalization-group method. When the model has long-range order at T=. O, the long-wavelength behavior at finite temperatures can be described by a purely classical model, with parameters renormalized by the quantum Auctuations. The low-temperature behavior of the correlation length and the static and dynamic staggered-spin-correlation functions for the quantum antiferromagnet can be predicted, in principle, with no adjustable parameters, from the results of simulations of the classical model on a lattice, combined with a two-loop renormal-ization-group analysis of the classical nonlinear o model, a calculation of the zero-temperature spin-wave stiffness constant and uniform susceptibility of the quantum antiferromagnet, and a one-loop analysis of the conversion from a lattice cutoff to the wave-vector cutoff introduced by quantum mechanics when the spin-wave frequency exceeds T/h Applyin. g this approach to the spin-2 Heisenberg model on a square lattice, with nearest-neighbor interactions only, we obtain a result for the correlation length which is in good agreement with the data of Endoh equal. on La2Cu04, if the spin-wave velocity is assumed to be 0.67 eV A/h. We also argue that the data on La2Cu04 cannot be easily explained by any model in which an isolated Cu02 layer would not have long-range antiferromagnetic order at T=0. Our theory also predicts a quasielastic peak of a few meV width at 300 K when kg«1 (where k is wave-vector transfer and g is the correlation length). The extent to which this dynamical prediction agrees with experiments remains to be seen. In an appendix, we discuss the effect of introducing a frustrating second-nearest-neighbor coupling for the antiferromagnet on the square lattice.},

abstract = {{Magnetic properties of the two-dimensional Hubbard-model are inferred from results of Monte Carlo simulations. Lattice sizes up to 8x8 and temperatures down to T=t/20 (t =hopping) were studied. The half-filled system is found to exhibit antiferromagnetic long-range order for all values of the Coulomb repulsion U. The low-temperature magnetic properties are found to be well described by spin-wave theory with renormalized local moment and spin-wave velocity. Numerical evidence presented suggests that when doped the system loses the long-range order immediately away from half filling. PACS numbers: 75. 10.Jm, 71.28.+d, 75. 10.Lp The magnetic properties of the two-dimensional Hub-bard model are of great current interest, as the model is likely to describe at least approximately some of the properties of the recently discovered oxide superconduct-ing materials. More generally, since it is the simplest quantum model of magnetism involving itinerant elec-trons, a detailed understanding of its properties is desir-able. We discuss here results of extensive Monte Carlo simulations of the model. In the half-filled band case, we determine the long-range order as a function of U and discuss to what extent spin-wave theory correctly de-scribes the magnetic properties. For the non-half-filled band, we present numerical evidence that suggests that the system loses its long-range order immediately under doping. Earlier Monte Carlo results on magnetic properties only reached temperatures down to P=4.5 (in units where the hopping t =1). A recent algorithmic ad-vance now allows us to reach much lower temperatures. Here we discuss results down to temperatures P=20 on lattice sizes up to 8 {\&}8. It is necessary to reach such low temperatures to be able to infer the ground-state proper-ties of the system. The model is defined by the Hamiltonian H= — tg(c; cj +H.c.)+Urn;ln;1 — pgn; (ij) l EO' We have studied lattices of sizes 4{\&}{\&}4, 6x6, and 8{\&}8, for values of U=2, 4, and 8 (in units where t =1).

For most simulations we chose our time-slice size h, {\~{}} such that h, r tU — 0.125. In the half-filled band case, the magnetic structure factor CLI2, LI2 (tr0ox =L/2, y =Lt2) (3) exhibit similar behavior, except that they go to zero more rapidly as T is increased.

We will discuss in detail the q dependence elsewhere. Re-sults for S(tr) are shown in Fig. 1 for values of U=4, 2, and 8. Note the different horizontal and vertical scales in the three cases. We have reached in each case tem-peratures low enough that S(tt) has essentially saturated at its ground-state values.

Figure 2 shows the extrapolation to hi=0 for U =4 and lattice sizes 4 x 4 and 2 x 2, for temperatures P =2, 4, and 8.

It is very expensive in computer time to perform accurate A{\~{}} extrapolations on larger lattices, and the systematic error will be buried in the statistical error unless very long runs are performed. Based on the results in Fig. 2 and similar results for Czy2zi2 we estimate that finite h, z (=0.167 in this case) increases our measured magnetic properties by about 5{\%} for the case U=4, and thus we will use this to correct our final estimates for the long-range order. Our statistical error should be much larger than any residual systematic error. Similar estimates yield a correction of 8{\%} for U=2, h, {\~{}}=0.25, and 2{\%} for U =8, h, i=0.125. To further convince ourselves that the results of Fig. 1 are close to ground-state values at the lowest tempera-tures it is desirable to have a theoretical model that fits the data and can carry us to much lower temperatures. As there is spin rotational invariance for any U and a gap for charge excitations, we would expect spin waves to be the dominant low-lying excitations (except perhaps for very small U) that determine the low-temperature properties of the system. Recently, Arovas and Auer-bach (AA) have shown how to obtain magnetic correla-tions for the two-dimensional Heisenberg model at finite temperatures within spin-wave theory.

abstract = {We analyze in detail the heating of bosonic atoms in an optical lattice due to incoherent scattering of light from the lasers forming the lattice. Because atoms scattered into higher bands do not thermalize on the time scale of typical experiments, this process cannot be described by the total energy increase in the system alone (which is determined by single-particle effects). The heating instead involves an important interplay between the atomic physics of the heating process and the many-body physics of the state. We characterize the effects on many-body states for various system parameters, where we observe important differences in the heating for strongly and weakly interacting regimes, as well as a strong dependence on the sign of the laser detuning from the excited atomic state. We compute heating rates and changes to characteristic correlation functions based on both perturbation-theory calculations and a time-dependent calculation of the dissipative many-body dynamics. The latter is made possible for one-dimensional systems by combining time-dependent density-matrix-renormalization-group methods with quantum trajectory techniques.},

abstract = {A theory of superconductivity is presented, based on the fact that the interaction between electrons resulting from virtual exchange of phonons is attractive when the energy difference between the electrons states involved is less than the phonon energy, Ace. It is favorable to form a superconducting phase when this attractive interaction dominates the repulsive screened Coulomb interaction. The normal phase is described by the Bloch individual-particle model. The ground state of a superconductor, formed from a linear combination of normal state configurations in which electrons are virtually excited in pairs of opposite spin and momentum, is lower in energy than the normal state by amount proportional to an average (Ace)', consistent with the isotope effect. A mutually orthogonal set of excited states in one-to-one correspondence with those of the normal phase is obtained by specifying occupation of certain Bloch states and by using the rest to form a linear combination of virtual pair con-figurations. The theory yields a second-order phase transition and a Meissner effect in the form suggested by Pippard. Calculated values of specihc heats and penetration depths and their temper-ature variation are in good agreement with experiment. There is an energy gap for individual-particle excitations which decreases from about 3.5kT, at T=O'K to zero at T,.

abstract = {We present results for the equation of state of the two-dimensional Hubbard model on an isotropic square lattice as obtained from a controlled and numerically exact large-cluster dynamical mean field simulation. Our results are obtained for large but finite systems and are extrapolated to infinite system size using a known finite-size scaling relation, and are supplemented by reliable error bars accounting for all sources of errors. We establish the importance of examining the decay of spatial spin correlations to determine whether a sufficiently large cluster has been used and with this in mind we present the energy, entropy, double occupancy, and nearest-neighbor spin correlations extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit. We discuss the implications of these calculations on pseudogap physics of the 2D Hubbard model away from half filling, where we find a strong behavioral shift in energy below a temperature T * which becomes more pronounced for larger clusters. Finally, we provide reference calculations and tables for the equation of state for values of doping away from half filling which are of interest to cold-atom experiments.},

Recent work by Paramekanti et al has shown that this variational approach gives a semi-quantitative understanding of the doping dependences of a variety of experimental observables in the superconducting state of the cuprates. In this paper we revisit these issues using the 'renormalized mean field theory' of Zhang et al based on the Gutzwiller approximation in which the kinetic and superexchange energies are renormalized by different doping-dependent factors g t and g S respectively. We point out a number of consequences of this early mean field theory for experimental measurements which were not available when it was first explored, and observe that it is able to explain the existence of the pseudogap, properties of nodal quasiparticles and approximate spin–charge separation, the latter leading to large renormalizations of the Drude weight and superfluid density. We use the Lee–Wen theory of the phase transition as caused by thermal excitation of nodal quasiparticles, and also obtain a number of further experimental confirmations. Finally, we remark that superexchange, and not phonons, is responsible for d-wave superconductivity in the cuprates.},

@article{Ho2009,
abstract = {At present, there is considerable interest in using atomic fermi-ons in optical lattices to emulate the mathematical models that have been used to study strongly correlated electronic systems. Some of these models, such as the 2-dimensional fermion Hubbard model, are notoriously difficult to solve, and their key proper-ties remain controversial despite decades of studies. It is hoped that the emulation experiments will shed light on some of these long-standing problems. A successful emulation, however, requires reaching temperatures as low as 10 −12 K and beyond, with entropy per particle far lower than what can be achieved today. Achieving such low-entropy states is an essential step and a grand challenge of the whole emulation enterprise. In this article, we point out a method to literally squeeze the entropy out from a Fermi gas into a surrounding Bose–Einstein condensed gas, which acts as a heat reservoir. This method allows one to reduce the entropy per par-ticle of a lattice Fermi gas to a few percent of the lowest value obtainable today. optical lattice emulator | quantum gases | entropy reduction C urrently, many laboratories are trying to realize the anti-ferromagnetic (AF) phase of the 3D Hubbard model by using ultra-cold fermions in optical lattices (1). Although the AF phase is well known in condensed matter, its realization will be a major step for the emulation program because it requires overcoming the serious challenge mentioned above that is common to all cold atom emulations (2). To understand the origin of the problem, recall that the strongly correlated states of lattice fermions emerge in the low-est Bloch band of the optical lattice. To put all the fermions in the lowest band, a sufficiently deep optical lattice is required. In such deep lattices, many known methods of cooling fail. For example, standard evaporative cooling does not work because the magnetic repulsive potential used in the evaporation process is not strong enough to overcome the deep lattice. As a result, all current exper-iments on lattice quantum gases resort to the conventional cooling scheme, first cooling the quantum gas in a harmonic trap (without optical lattice) to the lowest-entropy state possible, and then turn-ing on the lattice adiabatically (3, 4). The hope is that one could reach the state of interest when the lattice depth is sufficiently high. To realize these strongly correlated states with the current scheme, it is necessary that the entropy of the gas prior to switching on the lattice be less than that of the strongly correlated state one wishes to achieve. For 3D fermion Hubbard models, recent stud-ies (5) show that it is possible to reach the AF phase slightly below the Neel temperature T N with the conventional cooling method. A similar calculation by Tremblay et al. (6) for the 2D Hubbard model, however, showed that the conventional scheme cannot reach even the pseudo-gap regime, which exists at a higher temper-ature than the anticipated superconducting phase. Although these calculations are for homogenous systems, they apply to confining traps as long as the majority of the sample is a Mott insulator with one fermion per site. These studies show that, even under optimal conditions, one can at most reach the AF phase close to the magnetic ordering, but not low enough temperatures to study ground-state properties. The problem of the conventional method is that it can only cool atoms before they are loaded onto an optical lattice. There is no way to reduce the entropy further once the lattice is switched on. Thus, the lowest entropy attainable today in an optical lat-tice plus harmonic trap is just the lowest entropy achievable in a harmonic trap alone. In the case of Fermi gases, it is S/N = $\pi$ 2 (T/T F) (7), where T F is the Fermi temperature in the trap. For T/T F = 0.05, which is very much the limit today, we have S/N ∼ 0.5. Any strongly correlated states with lower entropy are unreachable by this method. It is therefore important to find ways to reduce the entropy of the system significantly below this value.},

Observing antiferromagnetic correlations or superfluidity in 2D systems requires a further reduction in entropy by a factor of 3 or more.

@article{Kanasz-Nagy2017,
abstract = {Do quantum correlations play a role in high temperature dynamics of many-body systems? A common expectation is that thermal fluctuations lead to fast decoherence and make dynamics classical. In this paper, we provide a striking example of a single particle created in a featureless, infinite temperature spin bath which not only exhibits non-classical dynamics but also induces strong long-lived correlations between the surrounding spins. We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of a hole created in a fermionic or bosonic Mott insulator in the atomic limit, which corresponds to a degenerate spin system. In the absence of interactions, the spin correlations arise purely from quantum interference, and the correlations are both antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic, in striking contrast to the equilibrium Nagaoka effect. These results are relevant for several condensed matter spin systems, and should be observable using state of the art bosonic or fermionic quantum gas microscopes. Understanding the role of quantum coherence in dynamics of many-body systems at high temperatures remains a chal-lenging open problem. Usually coherence is fragile and quickly destroyed by interaction with the environment and by local fluctuations inherent to thermal ensembles. Hence it is commonly assumed that observing quantum coherent dy-namics requires preparing isolated quantum systems close to their ground states. Famous experimental demonstrations of quantum coherence, including interference of Cooper pairs in nanostructures [1, 2] or interference of atomic Bose-Einstein condensates and superfluids [3–5], have all been achieved un-der these conditions. On the other hand it has been argued that quantum interference can lead to strong deviations from simple classical dynamics. For example, the breakdown of spin diffusion was predicted for the Heisenberg model even at infinite temperature [6–8]. Several important examples can be found in biophysics: in photosynthesis the interplay of quantum interference and decoherence leads to a much faster energy transport than would be possible classically [9–11]; quantum coherence has also been suggested to play a crucial role in bird navigation [12] and the chemistry of smelling [13]. Understanding how quantum interference can operate at high temperatures is therefore a crucial question, with tremen-dous potential for quantum information science [14–16], con-densed matter [17] and biology [18]. Whereas it is well understood that the entanglement of a subsystem with its environment leads to dephasing that drives the subsystem towards classical behavior, the fate of quantum coherence created in the environment is much less discussed. It is conventionally assumed that the environment's coherence quickly vanishes due to dephasing among its large number of degrees of freedom [19]. Here, we show however that this is not necessarily the case. We present a surprising example, where adding a single quantum particle to an infinite tempera-ture spin environment can lead to appreciable dynamical cor-relations among the spins (Fig. 1). We consider a system of non-interacting spins on a two-dimensional lattice, which is routinely realizable with bosonic or fermionic ultracold quan-tum gas microscopes. In a deep optical lattice, on-site repul-sion brings the atoms into a Mott state, where each site is oc-cupied by exactly one atom. The spins are represented by in-ternal degrees of freedom of the atoms, such as their hyperfine states [20] or nuclear spins [21], with N = 2S + 1 degrees of freedom, modeling a spin S system. In the limit of strong on-site repulsion, the spins completely decouple, as virtual tunneling to the neighboring sites is suppressed. This real-izes a non-interacting spin system discussed here. Removing a spin on one site creates a hole that can move on the lattice at no energy cost and permute the spins during its motion [22– 25] (Fig. 1 a-b). In contrast to a classical particle perform-ing Brownian motion, that would only scramble the random spins along its path and keep the environment completely dis-ordered, the quantum mechanical hole is capable of exploring alternative paths in parallel. As each path can lead to different permutations of the spins, the superposition of these outcomes creates entanglement in the spin bath. This leads to dynam-ical spin correlations in the environment, whereas individual sites remain paramagnetic. In contrast to the usual polaron ef-fect, where a particle locally modifies its environment due to their interaction [26–34], these correlations arise purely from quantum interference. Our system is also closely related to the ideas of dissipa-tionless decoherence [35, 36], studied in the context of quan-tum information [15, 16], condensed matter [37] and cosmol-ogy [38]. Even though there is no energy transfer between the hole and the environment, the hole's propagation is slowed down as quantum coherence is suppressed due to its entan-glement with the surrounding spins as was studied in Ref. 25. The new insight of our work is that this process also induces spin correlations in the environment (Figs. 1 and 2), and there-fore these correlations and decoherence are intimately related. The non-interacting system discussed here is special in the sense that the degrees of freedom in the environment are all degenerate, which suppresses the effects of dephasing. In fact, during the time scale of our simulations, these correlations re-main finite. We identify the interference terms that make the hole's dynamics dependent on the environment's spin S [25]. These terms are identical to those that generate spin correlations in the environment, and they vanish exponentially in environ-ments of large spin. Finally, we find that the simple analytical model of a hole on the Bethe lattice [39] closely approximates},

abstract = {The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) is one of the most powerful numerical methods for studying two-dimensional quantum lattice systems, despite a perception that it is only suitable for one dimension. Reviewing past applications of DMRG in 2D demonstrates its success in treating a wide variety of problems, although it remains underutilized in this context. We present techniques for performing cutting-edge 2D DMRG studies including methods for ensuring convergence, extrapolating finite-size data, and extracting gaps and excited states. Finally, we consider a selection of recently developed 2D tensor network methods and compare the performance of one of these to 2D DMRG.},

@article{Drewes2016,
abstract = {Near zero temperature, quantum magnetism can non-trivially arise from short-range interactions, but the occurrence of magnetic order depends crucially on the interplay of interactions, lattice geometry, dimensionality and doping. Even though the consequences of this interplay are not yet fully understood, quantum magnetism is believed to be connected to a range of complex phenomena in the solid state, for example, in the context of high-{\$}T{\_}c{\$} superconductivity and spin liquids in frustrated lattices. Ultracold atomic Fermi gases in optical lattices constitute an experimental system with unrivalled tunability and detection capabilities to explore quantum magnetism by analog quantum simulation. In this work, we study the emergence of antiferromagnetic correlations between ultracold fermionic atoms in two dimensions with decreasing temperature. We determine the magnetic susceptibility of the Hubbard model from simultaneous measurements of the in-situ density of both spin components. At half-filling and strong interactions our data approach the Heisenberg model of localized spins with antiferromagnetic correlations. Moreover, we observe the disappearance of magnetic correlations when the system is doped away from half-filling. Our observation of the dependence of quantum magnetism on doping paves the way for future studies on the emergence of pseudogap and pairing phenomena away from half-filling.},
